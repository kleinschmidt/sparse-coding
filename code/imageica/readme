1. WHY DID WE WRITE THIS PACKAGE?
---------------------------------

The purpose of this package is to provide data and code for estimating 
the proposed models from image data. This is to allow fellow researchers 
to duplicate our results and to ease the application of this method
to other datasets. 

----------------
2. HOW TO USE IT
----------------

First and foremost, read this whole file first. Especially the section
on hardware requirements. Below is the directory structure of the package:

code/
  data.m          - code for gathering the patches from the images
  estimate.m      - the algorithms for estimating the basis
  visual.m        - displays the found bases
  demo.m          - usage examples

data/
  The original gray-scale images in TIFF format

results/
  all results are stored here in MATLAB "*.mat" data files

Estimating bases for image windows is easy. To launch the demo
examples, move to the 'code' directory, and use the MATLAB commands

>> demo(1);
>> demo(2);
>> demo(3);

to estimate the ICA/ISA/TICA models (respectively). Each estimation
will continue indefinitely, writing the current state to disk every
five iterations. At any time you can use

>> demo(4);

to display the results so far. Note that the ICA estimation 
converges much faster than the other models due to the nice properties 
of the FastICA algorithm used. Also, the ISA estimation is faster
than TICA due to lower computational costs. 

------------------------
3. COMPUTER REQUIREMENTS
------------------------

The estimations with large windows (example code #1-4 in 'demo.m') 
require on the order of 600 megabytes of memory. This large number
is due partly to MATLAB's way of handling memory, partly to the fact
that the code was written with clarity, not memory-efficiency, as a 
main objective. However, the estimation with small windows (#5-8) 
use much less memory and may be a good place to start.

Even with the memory, the large window runs take long to 
converge to nice-looking filters. The ICA estimation requires something 
like a hundred iterations, the ISA needs around 200 iterations, 
and TICA on the order of 300. Again, if you do not have the 
computational power for that (or you would like results quickly), 
you can run the example codes #5-8 which are not as computationally 
demanding (although the results are not as nice due to small window
size).

This package was written for MATLAB version 5.3, although it will 
probably work well both with earlier and later versions.

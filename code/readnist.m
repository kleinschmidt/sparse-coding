% READNIST
%
%  [ts,sr]= READNIST (filename,[sr])
%
%  Reads NIST WAV/SPHERE files, such as those in N/C/TIMIT or
%  Switchboard or Mandarin-VOA TDT files.
%
%  filename can be provided with or without the .wav/.sph/.WAV/.SPH extension.
%
%  Example usage: to read '/blah/blah1/timit/dr1/fcjf0/sa1.wav' just say
%    [ts,sr] = readnist ('/blah/blah1/timit/dr1/fcjf0/sa1');
%  or 
%    [ts,sr] = readnist ('/blah/blah1/timit/dr1/fcjf0/sa1.wav');
% 
%  To read the ntimit file '/blah/blah1/ntimit/dr1/fcjf0/SA1.SPH'
%  just say
%    [ts,sr] = readnist ('/blah/blah1/ntimit/dr1/fcjf0/SA1');
%  or
%    [ts,sr] = readnist ('/blah/blah1/ntimit/dr1/fcjf0/SA1.SPH');
%  
%  ts is a Nx1 vector of entries representing the sound sample in filename
%  sr represents the sample rate, and you DON'T have to supply it - this
%     function works it out from the file headers automatically.
%     If you do supply it, any sample rate info contained in headers is ignored.
%  The sr that is returned is 
%    : the one input, or (if none is input)
%    : the sample rate in the file, or 
%    : 0 (if no sample rate is supplied by the user or the file headers)
%
%  The first line of filename should have NIST_1A in its header
%    otherwise ts = [] and sr = 0
%
% Assumptions:
%  - first line of file has NIST_1A
%  - second line has an integer, usually 512 or 1024, that has the number of
%     bytes in the header
%  - the header has a line of the form "sample_rate -i D", where D is an 
%     integer like 16000 that is the sampling rate in Hertz. 
%  - the header has a line with "sample_byte_format" (if not, little endian
%     is assumed) and if so, that this line is either 
%     "sample_byte_format -s2 01" (little endian) or
%     "sample_byte_format -s2 10" (big endian) 
%
% You should be able to play the sound with the Matlab command
%   soundsc (ts,sr)
% afterwards, assuming your sound card exists and works. (If it doesnt, 
% pray hard, and try again.)
%
% This file has only been tested on TIMIT, NTIMIT, CTIMIT and Switchboard (ICSI-WS97) files.

% NOTE ON SHORTENED FILES 
% Update: if you are on a unix-based system, you can also read
%   'shorten'ed files. This requires that you change the current
%   Matlab directory to one where you have write permission and
%   enough space to store an uncompressed version of the sound
%   file. The uncompressed file will be deleted afterwards, dont
%   worry! 
%     The current directory should also have a copy of shorten 
%   (If not, modify the command in this file that reads
%
%     cmd = ['shorten -x -d' num2str(headerlen) ' ' filename ' ' tmpfilename ';'];
